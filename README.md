# Gesture-Recognition-Flask-API

This Flask API integrates a pre-trained gesture recognition model capable of recognizing seven hand gestures: 👍 (thumbs up), 👎 (thumbs down), ✌️ (peace sign), ☝️ (index pointing up), ✊ (closed fist), 👋 (waving hand), and 🤟 (love-you gesture). The API accepts images in the form of multipart/form-data, allowing users to upload hand gesture images for real-time recognition
